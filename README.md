# Data-Visualisation
This contains two projects from the Second Semester of Life Science Informatics in Technische Hochschule Deggendorf.

The first project was the use of R to analyze the US data from project Tycho and develop our own hypothesis from the data.
This project involved the use of ggplot and the addon Esquisse to generate plots that clearly illustrate the point we were trying to make.

The second of the two projects was the use of python to generate plots and images using matplotlib, pandas, numpy and pathces.
